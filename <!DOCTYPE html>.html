  <p>
  The Darian calendar is a proposed system of timekeeping designed to serve the needs of any possible future human
  settlers on the planet Mars.
  </p>
  <p>
  It was created by aerospace engineer, political scientist, and space jurist Thomas Gangale in 1985 and named by him
  after his son Darius.
  </p>
  <p> 
  It was first published in June 1986.
  In 1998 at the founding convention of the Mars Society the calendar was presented as one of two calendar options to be
  considered along with eighteen other factors to consider for the colonization of Mars.
